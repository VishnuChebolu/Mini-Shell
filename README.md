# Mini Shell in C
This is a shell, written in c. 
Used basic functions such as pid, process forking, threading for all the commands to execute. This shell contains 9 basic functions, of a general linux shell. There will be a loading screen, when the user starts the shell and then it gives the provision to enter commands and view their output.

## Instead of having normal commands, here, Iâ€™ve recreated all the functions with inbuilt error handling feature.
